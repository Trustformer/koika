# K么ika-SUSHI
This is the fork of K么ika maintained by the
[SUSHI](https://team.inria.fr/sushi/) team
([original home](https://github.com/mit-plv/koika)).
K么ika is a rule-based Hardware Design Language embedded within Coq. We use it to
develop and verify hardware.

## What's different?
* Support for more recent Coq versions
* Support for proofs using the progressive rewriting approach described in
  [our paper](https://inria.hal.science/hal-04118645/document)
* Support SMT powered proofs
* Reorganized codebase
* Extended RV processor (moved to
  [its own repository](https://gitlab.inria.fr/SUSHI-test/herve))

## Getting started
Using OCaml 5.1.1 (`opam switch create koika-sushi ocaml-base-compiler.5.1.1`):
```bash
opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
opam install coq.8.19.2 coq-record-update dune base core stdio parsexp hashcons zarith core_unix
dune build
```
To install the resulting library on your system: `dune install`.

Simplest way to compile everything, including examples and tests: `make`
from the root. This creates an `_objects` folder in e.g. `examples`. This folder
contains a subfolder per example, which includes everything required to actually
synthesize it (such as a `Makefile` which is discussed in more details in
`examples/README.md`).

To run C++ simulations, you need ((`g++` or `clang`) and `libboost-dev`).

## Learning K么ika
Read [the original paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3385412.3385965),
get your hands dirty in `examples`, have a chat with us.

For proofs using progressive rewriting, read
[our paper](https://inria.hal.science/hal-04118645/document). We recommend the
SMT approach over this, just note that it is currently poorly documented for the
time being. Head to the repository of
[our processor](https://gitlab.inria.fr/SUSHI-test/herve) to see it in action.

## Who worked on this in SUSHI?
Current members:
* @pwilke, professor
* @mbaty, PhD student

Past members:
* @gdesfren, intern: reworked most of the
  [processor example](https://gitlab.inria.fr/SUSHI-test/herve) to add
  privileges

## Plans
Currently nothing concrete.

@mbaty is working on porting
[FIRRTL](https://github.com/chipsalliance/firrtl-spec) to Coq as
[COQQTL](https://gitlab.inria.fr/these-matthieu-baty/coqqtl).
This is a language that is more modular and overall more industry compatible
(part of the [LLVM-CIRCT](https://circt.llvm.org/) toolchain).
